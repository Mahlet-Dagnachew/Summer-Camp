				<p> The developer of this website is, infact, moi. It's one of hopefully many, and the progress will be seen when I make my next one,so look out for that. <br></p>
				<p>I'm currently 15 years old, and go to Trillium School. I will be in 10th grade 2022/2023. I made this website during my summer break, at EPS. The course is called Digital Skills, and is 5 weeks long.<br></p>
				<p>It was a fun, although sometimes tedious, job. </p>

		<h2> Hobbies </h2>
		<p>If I were to list out all my hobbies, we'd be here all day, so here are the top contenders; <br>
			I like to read, write, draw, and I make attempts at crocheting and knitting. I can use plenty more work, but I enjoy playing piano and guitar.</p>
		<h2>Goals and Such</h2>
		<p>It would be nice if I could develop a website that has contents written by me. Of course, there are a lot of important things besides money. But you can't deny that it's also very important. It'd be nice if - someday- I could get paid by doing work like this. Maybe a bit more challenging, but this was pretty fun. <br>
			I've gathered all the basics of making a website, and if asked, I could make one from scratch and host it online. Thank you to my mom for enrolling me, becuase now I have a pretty important skill at hand. <br>
			To anyone reading this and thinking 'man I wish I could do this kind of thing', just go for it. Youtube is a good place for website tutorials, and if I can do it, you can, too.
