		<p>Student circles are student-driven and teacher-supervised organizations that help students explore their interests, hone their talents, and learn new skills. Circles are also a venue for like-minded students from different levels and classes to meet and make friends. Student clubs allow students to practice their social skills and teach them the importance and benefit of networking with other people. </p>
