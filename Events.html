		<h3>1. NATIONAL LANGUAGE MONTH </h3>
			<p>Buwan ng Wika is a month-long event celebrating the Filipino language and culture. Throughout the month, there will be activities like declamations, poetry readings, and musical performances celebrating our national heritage's beauty and virtues.</p>
		<h3>2. NUTRITION MONTH</h3>
			<p>Nutrition Month celebrates the importance of a healthy body and sound mind. Students are taught about proper nutrition and living a healthy lifestyle throughout the month through film showings, special classroom lessons, and cooking and food preparation activities.</p>
		<h3>3. STUDENT COUNCIL ELECTIONS </h3>
			<p>The Student Council Election gives our young students a first-hand glimpse into the democratic process of electing leaders. Two parties comprised of the most outstanding students campaign for the student body's votes through public speeches, debates, and discussion of their platform. Students from grades 1 to 10 vote and elect who will represent and lead them for the rest of the school year.</p>
		<h3>4. SIGLAKAS FAMILY SPORTS DAY </h3>
			<p>SIGLAKAS is a word derived from the Filipino words “Sigla” (vigor) and “Lakas” (strength). It is a two-day sports fest where students and their parents participate in various games from tug-of-rope, volleyball to basketball. Its purpose is to develop sportsmanship, cooperation, and bring the whole family together.</p>
		<h3>5. BOOK WEEK CELEBRATION</h3>
			<p>Book Week is a time-honored celebration to raise awareness among students on the importance of books and literature. Throughout the five day celebration, there will be many educational but fun activities such as poetry reading, story writing contests, arts and crafts projects, and a colorful costume parade where students wear their favorite book and comic character.</p>
		<h3>6. HOLY CATHOLIC MASS CELEBRATIONS </h3>
			<p>The SFAMSC family regularly celebrate Holy Catholic Mass during special occasions like First Friday and Foundation Day to honor our Heavenly Father and thank him for all of his blessings on the SFAMSC and its community.
		<h3>7. TEACHERS' DAY </h3>
			<p>World Teacher Day is a special event where our students show their love and gratitude for their teachers. Students express their appreciation to their beloved second parents by giving them small gifts and performing songs, dance, speeches, and poetry.</p>
		<h3>8. EDUCATIONAL TRIPS</h3>
			<p>Educational trips enrich the students' learning by taking them to important locations related to their lessons in subjects such as art, history, science, and biology. Educational trips allow students to experience learning in exciting new environments outside their day-to-day school activities.</p>
		<h3>9. FIRST COMMUNION</h3>
			<p>The First Communion brings closer the sacred mystery of Christ into the lives of our students.</p>
			<p>As a Catholic school, SFAMSC coordinates with the nearby Lady of Light Parish Church to prepare our Catholic students to receive their First Holy Communion.</p>
		<h3>10. SCOUTING JAMBOREE</h3>
			<p>The Annual SFAMSC scouting jamboree is an overnight event where students rough it out to learn the fundamental skills of outdoor survival such as camping, emergency first aid, and outdoor cooking. These activities aim to build character, physical fitness, and internalize the Scout Oath and Scout Law values. Here is a brief video of our scouting jamboree.</p>
		<h3>11. HIGH SCHOOL NIGHT</h3>
			<p>High School Night is a coming-of-age event with two goals: first, help students prepare for young adulthood by bringing all of them together to practice the good social graces and etiquette in a formal setting. Second, here is when grade ten students formally pass their responsibility as leaders of junior high to the next generation of grade ten leaders.</p>
		<h3>12. ACADEMIC CONTESTS</h3>
			<p>SFAMSC holds an annual Academic competition from preschool to grade 10 as an opportunity for students to further deepen their knowledge in fundamental subjects like math and science. These contests are designed to inspire students to study and enjoy the thrill of competition!</p>
		<h3>13. MUSICAL-LITERARY CONTESTS</h3>
			<p>The Musical-Literary Contest aims to bring out the non-academic talents of students through public performances such as song, dance, and poetry. Usually, shy and quiet students are encouraged to join to show the world their hidden talents. Public performances build self-esteem and increase confidence.</p>
		<h3>14. FOUNDATION DAY</h3>
			<p>We commemorate the foundation of our school every end of January. We celebrate by having fun activities such as a talent show, field demos, fundraising games by the parent councils, and a school bazaar operated and organized by the student council. Parents and relatives are all invited to join their children in this opportunity for bonding and togetherness.</p>
		<h3>15. OUTREACH PROGRAMMES</h3>
			<p>The SFAMSC outreach is a volunteer program for students, parents, and guardians who wish to bring the light of Christ and spirit of St Francis to the less fortunate. Every year the SFAMSC family brings donations, food, and good cheer to places like nursing homes for the aged, orphanages, and depressed communities. Here is a video of one of our outreach programs.</p>
		<h3>16. PARENTING SEMINARS</h3>
			<p>Parenting is the most challenging job in the world; that is why we do our best to support our parents in any way we can. Twice a year, during our Parent-Teacher Conference, we invite experts from education and child development to give our parents informative lectures and seminars. These lectures are free, and everyone is welcome to join!</p>
